## Forging code with a little fire

I'm a very passionate software engineer who loves learning new things and diving headfirst into unfamiliar territory. New language? New stack? Ancient tech? No problem. Do you need me to learn COBOL? Sure! I genuinely enjoy the process of mastering whatever tools a project needs

I make sure to bring a loving craft to every project I work with, and I design everything to bring warmth, personality, and a bit of magic. I care deeply about polish, delightful interactions, and building software that feels alive rather than purely functional

When I'm not tinkering with code, I'm usually daydreaming about dragons, the majestic, fire-breathing kind. If you notice a fondness for scales and claws, that's very much intentional

You can find my work here on GitHub, as well as on my website at https://zarkforge.xyz, where I share what I'm currently forging. Feel free to explore, poke around, or say hi
