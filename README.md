## Forging code with a little fire

I'm a very passionate software engineer who loves learning new things and diving headfirst into unfamiliar territory. New language? New stack? Ancient tech? No problem. Do you need me to learn COBOL? Sure! I genuinely enjoy the process of mastering whatever tools a project needs

I'm also the developer behind [Ember](https://github.com/Kawtious/Ember), a small but lovingly crafted Discord bot designed to bring warmth, personality, and a bit of magic into servers. I care deeply about polish, delightful interactions, and building software that feels alive rather than purely functional

When I'm not tinkering with code, I'm usually daydreaming about dragons, the majestic, fire-breathing kind, and creating in spaces where imagination and technology overlap. If you notice a fondness for scales, claws, and cozy fantasy vibes, that's very much intentional

You can find my work here on GitHub, as well as on my website at https://zarkforge.xyz, where I share what I'm currently forging. Feel free to explore, poke around, or say hi
